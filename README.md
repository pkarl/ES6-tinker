# ES6 Tinker

This is an app being developed during weekly pairings on an ad-hoc basis for mentorship and discussion.

## setup

* `npm install`

## to run

(There is no UI component as of yet. Only tests)

* `npm test`

## Questions / comments / GROSS WHY DID YOU WRITE IT THAT WAY

This app is a scratch pad and the result of lot of verbal "do this, don't do this" during pairing. You'll probably see a need to refactor or otherwise clean things up. Take it with a grain of salt.

That said, if you drift in here and have questions or opinions or see a lesson worth teaching, leave a comment!
